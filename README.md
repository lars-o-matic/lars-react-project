# Lars's Juno React class project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses react-router-dom and firebase, among other libraries.

## About this app

This project is a simple game. A single player is shown pairs of images, one a real photo and the other generated by a GAN (artificial intelligence) to simulate the subject. In each round, the player guesses which image is the real photo in the current set. Because internet, I used cats :-)

The game pulls images from a photo API and from a GAN source URL; players' names and scores are recorded in a hosted database. A score board lists high scores from all players.

This is my project for the [ReactJS 8-week class](https://junocollege.com/course/react) from [Juno College](https://junocollege.com) (formerly HackerYou) in spring 2021.

Huge thanks to instructors Darshana and Talia and coach Zena!
